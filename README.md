**Test task for bloomon**

As for Feb.11, 2020, user does not need anything special to run this script, except the following:
- you need python3.5+ interpreter installed;
- you are familiar with *nix system;

This version works with sample data provided along with app.py.

The simplest way to use it (without containerization) is:

`$ cat sample.txt | python app.py`

this will pass data from sample.txt file as an input data for app.py script.

Few ways to proceed:
- research in order to define if usage of `deque` objects is applicable;
- moving to class;
- adding test cases.
